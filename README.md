# 🏷️ Smart Product Labelling and Traceability System

An Intel Unnati Industry Training Project using Raspberry Pi 4, Computer Vision (YOLO), and real-time database logging to ensure RoHS compliance and detect PCB defects on a conveyor belt system.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🎞️ IR sensor detects product entry on conveyor  
- 🎥 Camera captures PCB image upon detection  
- 📄 QR is read → Device ID & Batch ID extracted  
- ✅ RoHS compliance verified from local database (`rohs_compliance.csv`)  
- 🔍 YOLOv8 model checks for cracks, holes, and burns on PCB  
- ❌ Non-compliant or defective PCBs are removed using servo motor  
- ⚙️ Conveyor belt is controlled via Raspberry Pi and motor driver  
- 🖨️ Final label (Device ID, Batch ID, RoHS Status, Result) is displayed on screen  
- 🗃️ All inspection records logged into `inspection_log.db`

## 🧪 How It Works

1. IR sensor detects incoming product  
2. Camera captures image → QR is read  
3. Device ID & Batch ID checked in RoHS DB (`rohs_compliance.csv`)  
4. If not compliant → PCB is rejected using servo  
5. YOLO model checks for defects (cracks, holes, burn)  
6. If defective → PCB is also rejected  
7. Label with result is displayed on screen  
8. Inspection is logged into `inspection_log.db`

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

# Step 1: Install dependencies

# Step 2: Run the system
python code/main.py

### 🗃️ Databases

- [📄 `rohs_compliance.db`](./database/rohs_compliance.db) – Stores known device IDs, batch IDs, and compliance info  
- [📄 `inspection_log.db`](./database/inspection_log.db) – Stores inspection results (pass/fail, timestamps, image references, etc.)

---

### 🤖 Model Info

- Trained on 300+ PCB defect images (crack, hole, burn) using YOLOv8  
- [🧠 `best.pt`](./models/best.pt) – Final trained YOLOv8 model weights
